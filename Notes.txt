NOTES ON HTML W3SCHOOLS COURSE AND THE PROJECTS ALONGSIDE.
PROJECT 1 ;
I dont understand why I can't use more than one property in my tags. especially h1.
Finally figured it out. You use only one set of quotes for the whole style property, using the semi-colons to seperate each property/value.
<!-- I see that inline styling makes my lines too long, for the next web page I should use internal styling and see how it makes my code looks.-->
<!-- You notice that for the image tag, I did not use the semi-colon(;) to seperate the properties yet it still worked.-->
<!--I tried using the propery/value thing without the style right after the tooltip, but it did not work. This proves that the "style element is very important and ca not be replaced"-->
<!--I tried styling the horizontal line by giving it the color property but it did not work, wonder why-->
<!--I can see that the "address - bdo and blockquotes like to stand alone aoutside paragraphs. I will try them within paragraphs later on though."-->
<!--NOTE: RGB/RGBA = (0 - 255)/(0.0 - 1.0); BLACK(0,0,0)/(255,255,255)WHITE. HEX = #RRGGBB (00 - ff); (#000000)/(#ffffff). HSL/HSLA = HUE - SATURATION - LIGHTNESS; H = (0 - 360)_(R-0, G-120, B-240);
S = (0% {SHADE OF GRAY} - 100% {FULL COLOR}); L = (0% {BLACK} - 100% {WHITE}).git 
-->

PROJECT 2;
<!--I noticed that the email link writes in blue and is underlined. I thought it was a mistake on my part but it seems to be generic. I hope to understand and experiment on this later.-->
<!--I will be using internal styling as you can see here. I used inline styling for the previous document-->
<!--Never write a comment in a style tag, it will cause confusion.-->
!--document.location seems to be JS version of href. Let me try the target attribute with it. I does not work, it keeps opening in the default tab.-->
<!--Remember to embed plain links so you can see the effects of your internal styling.-->
<!--Styling a button as a link is entirely different from styling a link as a button, the syntax is quite deceptive. I have just styled a link as a button, and I noticed that if you have links in form of images, it would be appropriate to use either white or transparent as the background color; as any color outside this would be noticeable and make the image look weird.-->
<!--Careful when using internal styling, it somehow limits your sponataneity. I make reference to using the "id" attribute for the first time and it coming out like a button simmply bacause of the internal styling. At this point, I prefer inline styling.-->
<!--Anything entered into the "href" attribute automatically becomes a link, whether or not, it is functional. Note though taht a bookmark link always begins with "#" symbol.-->

I am presently unable to practise the "map"concept due to lack of full understanding.
I am presently struggling to work the background-image angle. No matter what I do it still does not reflect on the browser. I have tried with both inline and internal styling.
Difficult areas : IMAGEMAP - BACKGROUND IMAGE - PICTURE - FAVICON.

PROJECT 3;
Today on tables, I realise that without the border property, the contents stay arranged but with no central container; say like a square or rectangle. I wonder why and if it is so.

NOTE: TRY VIEWING YOUR PROJECTS ON ALL AVAILABLE BROWSERS AND DEVICES, MAKE OBSERVATIONS AND NOTE THEM DOWN.

For the "border" property to be active in a page, you use internal styling, inline styling will not cut it.
Contrary to my previous observation {i.e the line before this}; the issue was that I used semi-colons in seperating the values hence the unresponsiveness. Also, to get the container for tables, you do the inline styling just for the table tag and it pops up. I will inline style for the "tr - td- th" and see how it goes.Though external styling is usually only done for "table - th - td". 
There is always a difference when you use "px" or "%" for your values, with the latter being more.
Omo! Styles do not work on the "tr" o. LOL...I don't know why I find it funny sha. I better understand why internal styling is the best for tables, because who gwt strength to dey replicate styles for each "th - td". "Height - :nth-child(even/odd)" property works for "tr" sha, with "px" sef not "%".
You can use both inline and internal styling together. 
The commas "'" used in seperating varying tags with same properties and values in the internal style tag, is VERY IMPORTANT.
Worthy of note, the "Width" property works with the inline styling of table, without the "Style" property. To add anything else you have to use the "Style" property
I notice in W3SCHOOLS example, when the ":nth-child(even>)" is used, it does not affect the heading, but in mine, it does. I wonder why. Turns out that I was the one who made the mistake. I used "th - td" in the internal styling instead of just "td".
When you center the lists in table-styling, they become vertically arranged.

PROJECT 4;
BLOCK & INLINE ELEMENTS
"DIV" is a container, you can use it to style sections of your code in place of inline styling or internal styling. Really interesting. Whereas, "SPAN" is used to style inline.
The "CLASS" element is amazing, it is the equivalence of a style sheet in a html document placed in the head section. All you have to do is refer to it in the "DIV" containers; this goes for the "SPAN" too.
Difference between "CLASS" and "ID" elements is whereas, the former is for everyone, the latter is unique to one.

IFRAME;
These are like webpages inside webpages, like the way ads are projected on websites.

PROJECT 4;
HTML JAVASCRIPT
So, I tried the content change part but mine is not working. Let me try to figure it out.
I still have not figured out what the problem with my "JS" is, infact, I have three scripts on one web page for different functions but all the buttons now seem to be working for only the latest script, all three of them.

My Very First Twitter Inspired Webpage Clone
I expect to use and fully understand the use and functions of the following, after this clone practise;
"SPAN - DIV - COLOR -Horizontal LIST with CSS- INTERNAL STYLING -ID - BR - ".
I have done the very basics, latr on is for alignment and proper appropriation of properties.
