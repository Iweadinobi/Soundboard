<p>Here is a quote on how listening to you helps.</p>
<blockquote style="color:#F24F07" cite="https://www.inpd.co.uk/blog/benefits-of-active-listening">
    In the busy environment of a workplace, it’s easy to become distracted while someone is talking, either by what’s happening around us or by our own thoughts. Active listening is about being present in the conversation and focusing on what the person is saying, and not on how we intend to respond to the other person when they finish speaking
