    <!--I dont understand why I can't use more than one property in my tags. especially h1.
        Finally figured it out. You use only one set of quotes for the whole style property, using the semi-colons to seperate each property/value.-->

<!--I tried using the propery/value thing without the style right after the tooltip, but it did not work. This proves that the "style element is very important and ca not be replaced"-->

<p>Here is a quote on how listening to you helps.</p>
<blockquote style="color:#F24F07" cite="https://www.inpd.co.uk/blog/benefits-of-active-listening">
    In the busy environment of a workplace, it’s easy to become distracted while someone is talking, either by what’s happening around us or by our own thoughts. Active listening is about being present in the conversation and focusing on what the person is saying, and not on how we intend to respond to the other person when they finish speaking
